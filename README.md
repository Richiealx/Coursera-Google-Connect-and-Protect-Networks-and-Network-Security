ðŸŽ“ Hello Guys! I am excited to announce that I have successfully completed the "Google Connect and Protect: Networks and Network Security" course on Coursera and have earned my certificate! ðŸš€

Throughout this comprehensive course, I delved into the fundamentals of networks and network security, gaining a deep understanding of various concepts and methodologies. From learning about network protocols like TCP/IP and DNS to exploring network segmentation and subnetting, operating system, and cloud hardening. I honed my skills in securing and optimizing network infrastructures.

The hands-on experience with networking tools like Wireshark and Nmap was particularly captivating, providing me with valuable insights into network traffic analysis and security assessments. The knowledge gained from this course has equipped me with the expertise to strengthen network defenses and safeguard against potential threats.

I am now eager to apply my newfound skills in real-world scenarios, fortifying home and business networks against cyber threats and ensuring the utmost protection for sensitive data. Looking forward to continually exploring advanced concepts in network security and staying at the forefront of this dynamic and critical field.
